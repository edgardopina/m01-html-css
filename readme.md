## Business Purpose

A basic website that offers fitness training services.


## Description

This project consist of a basic web page created using basic [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) tags and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) styling. It provides meaning, context, and functionality to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) elements by using specific semantic elements and attributes. The [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) styling provides style and layout control.

Some [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) elemets are particularly useful for accessibility and functionality purposes in this small project: [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article), [section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section), [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe), [address](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address).

__Important:__ Although this project captures a form data, it is not intended (at this time) to be connected to a database (due to the simple goal of showcase the use of basic elements of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) & [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) technologies __only__).
